"""The one network client in `src/`: POST typed questions to Jev and classify the reply.

`omh_jev_ask` is the only caller (`tests/test_handoff_safety_contract_enforcement.py`
pins that no other module imports this one). Everything here exists to keep a
single explicit, user-requested call narrow:

* Two routes, fixed in `ROUTES`. The URL never comes from an argument or an
  environment variable. `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` is deliberately ignored: honoring
  it would let one variable send the user's key to any host.
* HTTPS only, default certificate verification, and every 3xx refused.
  CPython's redirect handler copies `Authorization` onto the redirected
  request, including to another host, so a redirect is a non-answer here.
* Bounded both ways: a request body above `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` is refused
  before a socket opens, and a response is read to `MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` at
  most.
* A retry only follows a reply that says the request was NOT processed: 429
  (rate limited) and 503/529 (overloaded), within `TOTAL_DEADLINE_SECONDS`.
  Any other 5xx -- 500, 502, 520-523 -- may come after the origin received
  and billed the request, so it is reported as `server_error` and the caller
  decides, the same way a timeout or a connection failure is never retried.
  A gateway timeout (504, 524) is a timeout in that sense -- the gateway gave
  up after the origin may have received the request -- so it is reported as
  `timeout`.
* The deadline also bounds the read: the body is read in chunks, the
  deadline is checked between them, and before each read the socket's own
  timeout is set to the time left, because urllib's timeout applies per
  socket operation and a server that trickles bytes would otherwise hold the
  turn a full attempt timeout past it. Residual: name resolution
  (`getaddrinfo`) has no timeout in the standard library, and the status line
  and headers are read inside `urlopen` under the per-operation attempt
  timeout; neither is bounded by the deadline.
* The key lives in one local variable of `send_ask`. It is never returned,
  never put in an error string, and any server text echoed back -- an error
  excerpt, the served model id -- has JSON escapes decoded and then every run
  that matches a substring of the key at least `MIN_KEY_FRAGMENT_CHARS` long,
  compared case-insensitively, redacted before it leaves this module; an echo
  that spells such a substring with whitespace between its characters
  redacts the whole excerpt.

Wire facts are `documented_not_observed` (docs.typesafe.ai/api.md and
openrouter.ai/docs/guides/community/typesafe-sdk.md, read 2026-09-23). Proxy
variables such as `HTTPS_PROXY` are honored by urllib, so a configured proxy
sees the destination host; `omh doctor` says so.

Stdlib and intra-bundle imports only: Hermes loads this directory with its own
interpreter.
