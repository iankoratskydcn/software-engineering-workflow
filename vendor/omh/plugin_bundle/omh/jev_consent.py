"""Whether the person asked for Jev in the current turn, recorded from their own words.

`omh_jev_ask` sends data off the machine, so it runs only when the human's
message for THIS turn names Jev. `pre_llm_call` is the one hook that receives
that message, once per turn, before the turn's tool calls; it records a
marker here and the tool reads it. A skill the model loaded on its own, a
bare "yes", or an earlier turn's request is not consent.

The rule is a fail-closed allow-gate on the person's text, not an inference
that stops work: a token equal to `jev`, a token that starts with `jev` and
continues with no Latin letter (`jev로`, `jev's`, `jev-1`), or an `omh-jev-*`
name sets the marker. Tokens split on anything that is not a letter or digit,
so `omh_jev_ask` counts as naming Jev, and a Latin letter after `jev` ends the
match, so `Jevons paradox` and `jevity` do not. The gate cannot tell a
negation apart -- "don't use jev" also sets the marker -- and the model can
still decline to call; that residual is documented rather than guessed around.

Only an attended platform can set it. `ATTENDED_PLATFORMS` is an allowlist of
the host platform ids where a person types the turn's message; every other id
-- `webhook`, `msgraph_webhook`, `api_server`, `batch`, `cron`, `subagent`, an
empty id, a plugin platform this list has not read -- records "not requested".
A single-query run (`HERMES_SINGLE_QUERY_SESSION=1`, Hermes `oneshot`, which
reaches the hook as platform `cli`) and a process started for a kanban task
(`HERMES_KANBAN_TASK`) are unattended too, as are a host-synthesized notice, a
tracker event, and a delegated child session.

The gate reads only the person's own text. Hermes assembles the user message
from host material and the person's words (`gateway/run_inbound.py`,
`_prepare_inbound_message_text`, read at hermes-agent origin/main 8fb0fc6ae6):

* host blocks prepended before the text, each closed by `]` and a blank line:
  `[Triggering message id: ...]` (Discord), `[Replying to...: "<quoted>"]`, a
  `[The user sent ...]` note per attachment or image, and per voice clip when
  speech-to-text is disabled, fails, or hears nothing;
* a successfully transcribed voice clip, prepended as a bare quoted paragraph
  `"<transcript>"` and a blank line, with no bracketed marker
  (`_transcribe_one_clip`, read at hermes-agent origin/main 16fe260aab);
* channel-history backfill, `<earlier messages>` then a blank line and
  `[New message]` on its own line before the text
  (`_prefix_inbound_sender_context`, on by default on Discord);
* in a shared multi-user session, a `[<display name>] ` sender prefix on the
  text itself;
* adapter-inlined material with no closing boundary: `[Content of <name>]:`
  file text and QQ's `[Quoted message]:` block;
* `@`-reference expansion, appended AFTER the person's text: Hermes runs
  `preprocess_context_references` over the whole assembled message, backfill
  included, and adds `--- Context Warnings ---` (a line per reference, each
  naming the reference) and `--- Attached Context ---` (fetched file, folder,
  git, or page content) on their own lines (`agent/context_references.py`,
  read at hermes-agent origin/main 6b6c7f4a99; the CLI and TUI turns run the
  same expansion). A backfilled `@file:jev...` from an unverified sender, or a
  page the person linked that says "call omh_jev_ask", lands there.

So the person's segment is found by cutting at the first expansion header
line, then after the last backfill separator or, without one, after the last
`]` plus blank line, and it counts only if no host-block opener and no other
bracketed line survives the cut; a message with inlined material records "not
requested" outright, because it cannot be split. The sender prefix is removed
before matching.

An expansion header next to a host block or backfill also records "not
requested" outright. The reply pointer and the Discord trigger note are
prepended AFTER expansion, and a quote keeps the other person's newlines, so
text alone cannot tell a header line spelled inside a quoted or backfilled
message from the host's own; cutting at it would leave the pointer's
opener, and a `]` plus blank line planted in the quote would then pick the
third party's line as the person's. The cost: a reply, or a backfilled turn,
whose own words name Jev next to an `@`-reference is not consent. Every other
step can only remove text, so a wrong cut fails closed.

On a messaging platform only the FIRST line of that segment counts, and a
media turn counts not at all: one whose message or newest user row in
`conversation_history` carries a content part that is not text (a
native-vision turn is an OpenAI-style list with an `image_url` part per image,
`build_native_content_parts` in `agent/image_routing.py`; with observed group
context the hook gets the plain-string persist form and only the history row
is the list), or whose text carries an attachment note (`[The user sent ...`,
`[Image attached ...`). A content list is read by its text parts, never
`str()`-ed.
Hermes merges inbound messages from different senders into the first
sender's event and keeps that sender's `user_id`: the text batcher appends
each chunk after a newline (`_append_text`; its key is the session, and
SimpleX keys it by chat, so a group's per-user session receives the others'
text too), and the busy-session pending slot appends captions and text the
same way (`merge_pending_message_event`, `gateway/platforms/base.py`, read at
hermes-agent origin/main f63c388e1a). A captionless photo takes another
sender's caption whole, so a media event's caption is nobody's certain words.
A voice clip is media too: the pending slot merges another sender's clip into
the owner's event, and its transcript is prepended as the first paragraph, so
a turn whose text opens with a quoted transcript paragraph is a media turn.
The cost is that an owner's "ask jev" on a second line, as a photo caption,
or spoken in a voice clip is not consent on a messaging platform; a terminal
surface has no such merge and keeps every line.

In a shared multi-user session any participant can type "ask jev", so there
consent needs the session's owner: the `sender_id` Hermes passed on the turn
that opened the session. That turn is `is_first_turn` with a history holding
nothing but its own message. A turn-start compaction rotation also arrives as
`is_first_turn` on a new session id, but with the compacted history (the
host's `parent_session_id` there is the delegation parent, not the rotation's
parent, so ownership cannot be carried over); it records no owner, and a
recorded owner is never replaced. A turn from any other sender never sets
the marker, and a shared turn whose owner this process did not see -- a
restart mid-session, a rotated child, an evicted record -- sets none either.
A session is known to be shared when its text carries the sender prefix, or
when a sender other than the recorded owner speaks. Residuals: a shared
session on a platform that supplies no display name, first seen by this
process after a restart, cannot be told from a direct message; and a
participant who opens a fresh session with `/new` (open to every participant
unless the host's `allow_admin_from` is set), or who speaks first after a
`/stop` suspended the session (Hermes starts a fresh session for the next
message, whoever sends it, `gateway/run_turn.py`), owns that session's
consent.

A bot is read as a person. Hermes drops other bots' messages by default and
accepts them when the operator opts in (`DISCORD_ALLOW_BOTS=mentions|all`,
`slack.allow_bots` / `SLACK_ALLOW_BOTS`); the adapter then sets
`SessionSource.is_bot`, and the turn runner passes it on only as
`turn_author.is_bot` to `run_conversation`, which hands it to memory
providers' `on_turn_start` and `sync_turn` (read at hermes-agent origin/main
16fe260aab). `pre_llm_call` receives `sender_id` and no bot flag, and a bot's
id has the same shape as a person's, so this gate cannot tell them apart.
Residual: on a profile that allows bot messages, a bot that relays
third-party text naming Jev -- a CI bot posting a PR title -- consents like
the person it stands in for, and in a per-user session it opened it is the
session's owner. Leave bot messages off on a profile with a Jev route.

Words the owner relays are read as the owner's own: no adapter marks a
forwarded message, and WeCom's quote-only messages and forwarded voice
transcripts reach the hook as plain text from the forwarding sender. A person
who forwards someone else's "ask jev" into their own chat has asked for Jev;
the owner is the one who decides what to forward.

The marker is bound to the turn that recorded it. `pre_llm_call` stores the
turn's `turn_id`; OMH's `pre_tool_call` arms each `omh_jev_ask` call under its
`tool_call_id` with the call's `turn_id`, and `post_tool_call` disarms it; the
tool proceeds only when every armed call runs in the recorded turn. A
background-review fork or a `/btw` side question shares the session id but runs
under its own `turn_id`, so it cannot spend the main turn's consent, and while
its call overlaps the main turn's, neither proceeds: the handler is not told
its own call id, so it cannot tell which arm is its own. Residual: a host path
that runs the tool without `pre_tool_call` leaves no arm of its own, and would
read another in-flight call's.

Process-local and bounded, like `session_attendance`: nothing about it is
written to disk. Every copy of this module in the process shares the one
state holder, because Hermes can load the bundle twice (#1939).
